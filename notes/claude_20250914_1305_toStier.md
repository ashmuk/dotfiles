 🚀 S-Tier Enhancements (Priority Order)

  1. 📊 Performance & Optimization (HIGH IMPACT)

  # Add shell startup benchmarking
  make bench-startup                # Measure shell startup times
  make profile-performance         # Performance profiling
  make optimize-lazy-loading       # Implement lazy loading framework

  Gap: No performance metrics or optimization
  S-Tier: Built-in benchmarking, lazy loading, startup time < 50ms

  2. 🤖 Advanced Automation (HIGH IMPACT)

  # .github/workflows/dotfiles-ci.yml
  - Automated dependency updates
  - Cross-platform testing matrix
  - Performance regression detection
  - Security vulnerability scanning

  Gap: Manual dependency management
  S-Tier: Self-healing, auto-updating ecosystem

  3. 🎯 Interactive Setup Wizard (MEDIUM IMPACT)

  make setup-wizard               # Interactive configuration
  # ┌─ Dotfiles Setup Wizard ─────┐
  # │ [x] Shell (bash/zsh)        │
  # │ [x] Vim (gui/terminal)      │
  # │ [ ] Development tools       │
  # └─────────────────────────────┘

  Gap: Command-line only setup
  S-Tier: Intuitive guided setup with previews

  4. 🔄 Hot Reloading & Live Config (MEDIUM IMPACT)

  make watch                      # Watch for config changes
  make reload                     # Hot reload without restart
  make config-server              # Live configuration editor

  Gap: Manual reload required
  S-Tier: Instant configuration updates, live preview

  5. 📈 Analytics & Intelligence (MEDIUM IMPACT)

  make analytics                  # Usage pattern analysis
  make optimize-suggestions       # AI-powered recommendations
  make health-check              # System health monitoring

  Gap: No usage insights
  S-Tier: ML-driven optimization suggestions

  6. 🏢 Enterprise Features (LOW-MEDIUM IMPACT)

  make team-sync                  # Team configuration sync
  make config-inherit             # Hierarchical configuration
  make audit-log                  # Change tracking/compliance

  Gap: Individual user focus
  S-Tier: Team collaboration, enterprise deployment
