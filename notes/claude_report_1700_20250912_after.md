## ⚠️ CONS: Areas of Concern

### 🔍 Complexity Trade-offs
- **High Learning Curve**: 2,600+ lines of new code may overwhelm new users
- **Feature Creep Risk**: Many advanced features might be unused by typical users
- **Debugging Complexity**: Lazy loading makes troubleshooting harder

### 🔒 Maintenance Burden
- **Plugin Dependencies**: vim-plug and plugins require ongoing updates
- **CI/CD Maintenance**: GitHub Actions workflow needs regular updates
- **Documentation Sync**: Multiple example files need consistent updates

### ⚡ Performance Concerns
- **Initial Overhead**: Performance framework adds startup cost
- **Memory Usage**: Caching system consumes disk space
- **Plugin Load Time**: Vim plugins significantly increase startup time

### 🎯 Adoption Barriers
- **Configuration Proliferation**: Too many customization options may confuse users
- **Platform Testing Gaps**: Windows native support still limited
- **Version Compatibility**: No automated testing for tool version changes
