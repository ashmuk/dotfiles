echo "WSL Bridge Functionality Demo"
echo "============================="
echo

echo "This demonstrates how the WSL bridge would work:"
echo

echo "1. WSL Detection:"
echo "   - Checks /proc/version for 'microsoft'"
echo "   - Checks \$WSL_DISTRO_NAME environment variable"
echo

echo "2. Path Conversion:"
echo "   - WSL path: /home/user/dotfiles"
echo "   - Windows path: \\\\wsl\$\\Ubuntu\\home\\user\\dotfiles"
echo "   - Target junction: C:\\Users\\user\\dotfiles"
echo

echo "3. Junction Creation:"
echo "   - Uses cmd.exe /c \"mklink /J\" to create junction"
echo "   - Junction links Windows %HOMEPATH%\\dotfiles to WSL location"
echo "   - PowerShell can then find dotfiles at expected Windows location"
echo

echo "4. Usage in WSL:"
echo "   make install-windows    # Automatically creates bridge"
echo "   make setup-wsl-bridge   # Create bridge manually"
echo

echo "5. Result:"
echo "   - Windows PowerShell config can access dotfiles"
echo "   - Single source of truth in WSL filesystem"
echo "   - No duplication of dotfiles between WSL and Windows"
echo

echo "Benefits:"
echo "- Seamless WSL/Windows integration"
echo "- PowerShell profiles work correctly"
echo "- Windows tools can access dotfiles"
echo "- Maintains single dotfiles location"
echo

echo "Requirements:"
echo "- WSL environment with wslpath command"
echo "- Windows junction creation permissions"
echo "- PowerShell available in WSL (powershell.exe or pwsh.exe)"
