# Tmuxinator Configuration for AI Development Session
#
# IMPORTANT: This file is intentionally named 'ai_dev.yml' instead of '.tmuxinator.yml'
#
# NAMING SIDE EFFECT WARNING:
# When a file is named '.tmuxinator.yml' in the project root, running 'tmuxinator --version'
# will automatically execute this configuration and start the tmux session as a side effect!
# This causes issues with health checks and diagnostic scripts that simply want to verify
# tmuxinator is installed without starting development sessions.
#
# To use this configuration:
#   tmuxinator start -p ai_dev.yml
#   OR
#   tmuxinator start ai_dev  (if moved to ~/.config/tmuxinator/ai_dev.yml)
#
# Session name: ai-dev
# Purpose: 4-pane development environment with parallel processes
