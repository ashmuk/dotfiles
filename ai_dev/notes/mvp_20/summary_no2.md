● Phase 2 Implementation Complete!

  Summary

  Successfully implemented Phase 2: Scalability Enhancements for the claude-tmux framework. The framework is
  now at MVP+ 2.0 stage.

  ---
  What Was Implemented

  1. Timeout Management ⏱️

  pane-exec-timeout <session> <pane> <timeout> <cmd>

  - Executes command with automatic timeout enforcement
  - Returns success if completes in time, error if timeout exceeded
  - Location: scripts/claude-tmux-bridge.sh:569-594

  Example:
  pane-exec-timeout dev 0 30 "npm run build"
  # Automatically fails if build takes >30s

  pane-watch-timeout <session> <pane> <pattern> <timeout> [lines]

  - Watches for pattern with deadline
  - Returns immediately when found, errors after timeout
  - Location: scripts/claude-tmux-bridge.sh:597-632

  Example:
  pane-watch-timeout dev 1 "SUCCESS" 10
  # Wait max 10s for pattern to appear

  ---
  2. Metadata System 🏷️

  pane-metadata-set <session> <pane> <key> <value>

  - Store custom key-value metadata per pane
  - Persisted in state file
  - Location: scripts/claude-tmux-bridge.sh:635-662

  pane-metadata-get <session> <pane> <key>

  - Retrieve stored metadata
  - Location: scripts/claude-tmux-bridge.sh:665-697

  Use Cases:
  pane-metadata-set dev 0 "role" "primary-server"
  pane-metadata-set dev 0 "owner" "backend-team"
  pane-metadata-set dev 0 "restart_count" "3"

  pane-metadata-get dev 0 "role"  # → primary-server

  ---
  3. Enhanced Listing 📋

  pane-list-detailed <session>

  - Returns panes with labels AND metadata
  - Merges tmux live data with state file
  - Location: scripts/claude-tmux-bridge.sh:700-764

  Output includes:
  - pane_id
  - label (from state)
  - pid, command, dimensions (from tmux)
  - is_running status
  - metadata object (custom key-values)

  ---
  4. Custom Layouts 🎨

  pane-create-with-layout <session> [label] [layout]

  - Creates pane with specified tmux layout
  - Location: scripts/claude-tmux-bridge.sh:767-820

  Supported layouts:
  - tiled (default) - Equal size grid
  - main-horizontal - Large top pane, small bottom panes
  - main-vertical - Large left pane, small right panes
  - even-horizontal - Equal horizontal split
  - even-vertical - Equal vertical split

  Example:
  pane-create-with-layout dev server main-horizontal
  # Server gets 50% height, others split remaining

  ---
  5. State Sync Enhancement 🔄

  - state_sync now preserves metadata across updates
  - Metadata survives pane state changes
  - Location: scripts/claude-tmux-bridge.sh:508-516

  Testing Results

  Phase 2 Tests ✅

  1. ✅ pane-exec-timeout: Command completed within 5s timeout
  2. ✅ pane-metadata-set/get: Stored and retrieved "role=primary-server"
  3. ✅ pane-create-with-layout: Created pane with main-horizontal layout
  4. ✅ pane-watch-timeout: Found "SUCCESS_PATTERN" before timeout
  5. ✅ pane-list-detailed: Returns labels and metadata (fixed array bug)

  Before vs After (Phase 1 vs Phase 2)

  Timeout Handling

  Phase 1:
  pane-exec dev 0 "long-running-task"
  pane-wait dev 0 60  # Separate step, manual timeout

  Phase 2:
  pane-exec-timeout dev 0 60 "long-running-task"
  # One command, automatic timeout

  Metadata Usage

  Phase 1:
  # No way to store custom data!
  # Had to track externally or use labels only

  Phase 2:
  pane-metadata-set dev 0 "region" "us-west"
  pane-metadata-set dev 0 "instance_id" "i-abc123"
  pane-metadata-get dev 0 "region"  # → us-west

  Layout Control

  Phase 1:
  pane-create dev server
  # Always uses tiled layout

  Phase 2:
  pane-create-with-layout dev server main-vertical
  # Server gets primary position

  ---
  Use Cases Unlocked

  1. Cloud Resource Tracking

  # Track which pane manages which cloud instance
  pane-metadata-set dev 0 "instance_id" "i-123"
  pane-metadata-set dev 0 "region" "us-east-1"
  pane-metadata-get dev 0 "instance_id"  # Later retrieval

  2. Smart Timeouts

  # Build with automatic timeout
  if pane-exec-timeout dev 0 300 "make build"; then
    echo "Build succeeded in <5 min"
  else
    echo "Build timeout - investigate"
    pane-kill dev 0
  fi

  3. Priority Layouts

  # Give server pane 70% of screen
  pane-create-with-layout dev server main-horizontal
  pane-create dev logs  # Logs get smaller space

  4. Deadline-Driven Monitoring

  # Wait for deployment, but not forever
  if pane-watch-timeout dev 0 "DEPLOYED" 120; then
    echo "Deployment succeeded"
  else
    echo "Deployment timeout - rollback"
  fi
