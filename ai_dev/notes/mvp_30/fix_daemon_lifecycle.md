● Excellent question! Yes, there's definitely room for improvement in daemon
  lifecycle management. Let me analyze the current issues and propose solutions:

     ## Current Architecture Issues
     ### Problem 1: Orphaned Daemon Processes
     **Issue:** Daemon continues running after all demo sessions complete.
     **Current Behavior:**
     ```bash
     ./scripts/demo-event-driven-quick.sh

● Excellent! I've created a comprehensive improvement plan. Let me summarize the key
   points:

  Summary: Yes, Significant Room for Improvement!

  Current Problems:

  1. Daemon orphaning - Persists after demos complete
  2. Manual cleanup required - Users must remember to stop daemon
  3. Shared state - Single daemon for all sessions
  4. No auto-lifecycle - Daemon doesn't know when it's no longer needed

  Recommended Solutions (Priority Order):

  🟢 Phase 1: Enhanced Cleanup Trap (IMPLEMENT NOW)

  - Effort: 30 minutes
  - Impact: Prevents most orphaning
  - Make demo scripts check if they're the last session before stopping daemon

  🟡 Phase 2: Reference Counting (Next)

  - Effort: 2-3 hours
  - Impact: Full auto-lifecycle
  - Daemon tracks sessions and auto-stops when all gone

  🔵 Phase 3: Session-Scoped Daemons (Future)

  - Effort: 1 day
  - Impact: Complete isolation
  - Each session gets its own daemon that auto-terminates

  Quick Wins:

  1. Tmux Hooks - Use set-hook session-closed to auto-cleanup
  2. Auto-timeout - Daemon stops after 5 min idle
  3. Health monitoring - Detect hung daemons
  4. Zombie prevention - Double-fork pattern

  ---
  Would you like me to implement Phase 1 now? I can update both demo scripts to
  include smart daemon cleanup that checks for other sessions before stopping. This
  would solve 80% of the orphaning problem with minimal changes!
