# CLAUDE.md (Global) — Claude Code preferences

- Prefer using repository-provided commands/scripts.
- If the repo defines "dangerous mode" aliases or elevated tools, require explicit user approval.
- Keep outputs structured: Plan / Actions / Verification / Notes.
- If a project has <project-root>/CLAUDE.md, follow it first.
